# ParkNGo Web Application
A web application that provides information, tools and services related to parking. The purpose of ParkNGo is to provide users with the best parking alternative so that they can plan their trip accordingly. ParkNGo will also allow users to rent out their parking spots to the public, like an Airbnb, where property owners set their own rate and time.
